  <p class="headline">Coronavirus (Covid-19) tracker India: State and district wise cases, daily trends, patients recovered and deaths</p>
  <img src="nation1.webp">
  <p class="con">HIGHLIGHTS
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi are the hotspots of Covid-19 cases in India
These three states have seen significant rise in new cases recently
Together, they account for 43% of India's Covid-19 cases
India is currently battling its worst health emergency in the form of the coronavirus outbreak that is spreading rapidly across the country with tens of new cases being reported every day. Though the government has maintained that India is yet not in the stage of "community transmission", new cases continue to be reported daily. The past one week has seen significant spike in the number of new cases being reported, especially in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. The scale of this health emergency is such that the entire country has been put under a 21-day lockdown and only essential services are operational.

In the 10 days between March 10 and 20, the number of people in India who tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, jumped from 50 to 196. By March 25, it reached 606 and by the end of the month (March 31) India had 1,397 confirmed Covid-19 cases. As on April 6, India's tally rose to 4,281 cases.

This health emergency has put immense pressure on the country's healthcare system and the economy has been severely disrupted. To help explain the scale of the coronavirus outbreak in India, IndiaToday.in is regularly analysing key data and trends related to this health emergency. We bring to you this in-depth analysis and a daily tracker on Covid-19 cases in India.

(Figures and charts used in this report are updated daily and are based on the data displayed on the website of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare at 11.59pm. Individual state governments may have different numbers. (Read the footnote for details on our methodology.))

  <p class="headline"> Coronavirus: Six people shot at California house party during lockdown</p>
  <img src="int1.jpg">
  <p class="con">Californian police say six people have been shot and injured at a "large" party despite the "stay at home" order in place in the US state.

The shooting took place on Friday night at an apartment complex in Bakersfield, the local sheriff's office says.

The victims - four women, one man and a girl - were treated for non-life threatening injuries.

No arrests have been made but four men, seen fleeing in a car, are suspected of carrying out the attack.

An investigation is under way, Kern County Sheriff's Department says.

Sweeping travel restrictions have been in place since last month in California, which is grappling with one of the worst outbreaks of coronavirus in America. As of 11 April, the state reported 21,794 cases and 651 fatalities.

Under an order by Governor Gavin Newsom, residents can only leave their homes to buy groceries and medicine, walk a dog or exercise.

Non-essential businesses have also been forced to close - others including grocery stores, pharmacies and petrol stations can remain open.</p>

<p class="headline"> Fauci says US 'could have saved lives' with earlier action</p>
<img src="int2.jpg">
<p class="con"> The US "could have saved lives" if it had introduced measures to stop Covid-19 earlier, a top health official says.

"If we had, right from the beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different," Dr Anthony Fauci told CNN. But he said making that decision had been complicated.

The US has over 555,000 virus cases and 22,000 deaths, many in New York.

Dr Fauci also suggested parts of the US could begin returning to normal as early as May.

On 16 March, the Trump administration issued social distancing guidance, which has since been extended through April.

What did Fauci say?
When asked about a New York Times report that Dr Fauci and other officials had suggested aggressive mitigation towards the end of February, Dr Fauci said health officials could only make recommendations from a "pure health standpoint".

"Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes, it's not. But it is what it is, we are where we are right now."

Dr Fauci, who is leading the US response to coronavirus, added that "no one is going to deny" that logically, earlier mitigation could have saved lives.

But he said "what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated".

"There was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then."

The top doctor also acknowledged that multiple factors were involved with the current situation in the US, such as the nation's size and heterogeneity, not just a later start on mitigation.

But he also said parts of the nation might be able to begin a slow return to normalcy "at least in some ways, maybe next month".

"You don't want to do something precipitously," Dr Fauci emphasised, noting that ending virus containment efforts too hastily could lead to a rebound.

"It's going to be depending on where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak you already experienced and the threat of an outbreak you may not have experienced."

Dr Fauci was also hopeful that the US presidential election, slated for 3 November, would still take place - if the nation takes a measured approach to lessening restrictions.

What's the situation in New York?
During a briefing later on Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he wanted his state, which has been the centre of the outbreak in the US, to open "as soon as possible".

But the governor was cautious, saying there had to be a co-ordinated approach between neighbouring states, more testing availability and additional federal funding.

Mr Cuomo was also sceptical of any forecasting, saying: "Every informed projection by experts, by the way, has not turned out correct."

That was good news, he noted, as it meant policies and social compliance had made a difference in the last few weeks.

"I've said from day one - all these predictions, we're gonna open businesses in May, do this in May, do this in June - I think that's all premature. I don't think anybody can make an informed decision right now."

New York has confirmed over 174,000 Covid-19 cases and seen 9,385 deaths.

Mr Cuomo said the number of deaths were stabilising, albeit at a "terribly high rate" - 758 people lost their lives in the last 24 hours. The death toll has remained in the 700s for the last few days.</p>
